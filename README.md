# css-challenge2ðŸŽ²

This is my submission to another CSS Challenge in Bryl's discord server. A layout of the challenge has been provided by https://github.com/mmmsss211

The challenge is to use the font (Teko) and copy the layout using any CSS frameworks. I used pure CSS only but it is still not yet responsive.
